### Background
Years ago I happened to eat lunch at the SCO university open air auditorium. Some lecturer was supposed to come up
and give a fun insight about ... something. To my amazement Kurt Vonnegut took the stage, and addressed the audience with the following question: "How do rhinoceroses see the world?"
The answer was: via smell.
